Learning, Coding, Innovating: My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository showcasing a series of machine learning projects! After completing a series of specialized courses in machine learning, I embarked on applying my knowledge to real-world problems through various projects.

My journey began with basic logistic regression models and has evolved to include more complex techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Decision Trees. Each project utilizes datasets from Kaggle, allowing me to explore and implement diverse algorithms and approaches.

In this repository, you will find a collection of my experiments with different models, each meticulously developed and trained to achieve optimal accuracy. My goal is to continually refine these models and enhance their performance, contributing to my ongoing learning and growth in the field of machine learning.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the models, and contribute to the discussion!
