### Overview
In recent years, deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, raising significant concerns about misinformation and authenticity in media. This project focuses on developing a robust deepfake detection system, recognizing it as a crucial tool in todayâ€™s digital landscape.

I have referenced two research papers that provide foundational insights into deepfake detection methodologies and their implications. This work aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in safeguarding information integrity and promoting responsible use of synthetic media.
