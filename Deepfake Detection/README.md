### Deepfake Image Detection

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing robust models for detecting deepfake images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a combined approach of CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

##### Objectives
- Create an effective deepfake detection system capable of distinguishing between real and fake images.
- Compare the performance of CNN models with hybrid CNN+LSTM models in handling deepfake detection tasks.

#### Methodology

#### Data Preparation
The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of labeled images categorized as "Fake" and "Real." The data underwent extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand class distribution, average image dimensions, and sample image visualization.

#### Model Development

1. **CNN Model**
   - A CNN model was constructed using multiple convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images.
   - The model included pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and enhance feature learning.
   - The architecture was optimized for accuracy and efficiency, focusing on detecting subtle differences between real and fake images.

2. **CNN+LSTM Model**
   - The CNN model was enhanced by incorporating LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns.
   - This approach is particularly beneficial for scenarios involving sequences of images (e.g., video frames).
   - The CNN layers extracted spatial features, while the LSTM layers processed the sequences to improve detection accuracy.

##### Training and Evaluation
Both models were trained on a substantial dataset, using techniques such as data augmentation to improve robustness. Performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate model effectiveness. A confusion matrix and classification report were generated to provide a detailed analysis of the models' predictive capabilities.

##### Results
- The CNN model demonstrated strong performance in detecting deepfake images with high accuracy.
- The CNN+LSTM model showed improved results in scenarios where temporal relationships in image sequences were critical, indicating its potential for more complex detection tasks.

##### Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of using CNNs for deepfake image detection, with the addition of LSTM layers providing enhanced capabilities for sequential data analysis. The findings contribute to the ongoing effort to combat the spread of misinformation through manipulated media.

#### Future Work
- Explore advanced architectures, such as attention mechanisms or Transformers, for improved detection performance.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse examples of deepfakes and enhance model generalization.
- Implement real-time detection systems for practical applications in various domains.
